<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This campfire pepperoni pizza is as easy as pie—no pun intended. The smoky flavor from the wood fire puts a great
    twist on an old favorite, and with the help of a pizza stone, doing this over an open fire is easier than you may
    think.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound refrigerated pizza dough</li>
    <li>¼ cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup sliced pepperoni</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place a pizza stone on an outdoor grill directly over a wood fire. You may first need to spread out the wood if
        the
        flames are too high.
    </li>
    <li>Roll out pizza dough on a flat surface to desired thickness. Place on pizza stone; cook until golden on one
        side,
        about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Remove from pizza stone. Spread pizza sauce in an even layer onto cooked side dough, leaving 1/2-inch edge bare.
        Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top of sauce; top with pepperoni.
    </li>
    <li>Place on pizza stone; tent with aluminum foil and cook until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. Transfer pizza
        to
        a cutting board. Cool slightly before cutting and serving.
    </li>
